# Documentation Website

You can contribute to this Docusaurus page by forking our [docs repo](https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j.github.io/).

You will need to install Node.js >= 18.0. You can obtain the recommended LTS at https://nodejs.org/en/download.

In addition, you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and yarn (can be [installed](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) from npm) package managers.
Consider using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) over npm.

With the docs repo checked out, you can run `yarn install` to download all the dependencies,
and start a local docs webserver (that will reflect your MDX changes in real-time) via `yarn start`.

We recommend you utilize our [javadocs](https://twitch4j.github.io/javadoc/) while updating any Docusaurus page to ensure accuracy.
